## Professional Experience

**Amazon Web Services – Data Engineering Intern (2025)**

At AWS, I architected robust data pipelines for enterprise-grade financial analytics and agentic AI orchestration. My work included automating ETL/ELT with AWS Glue and deploying modular Airflow DAGs on MWAA. I optimized real-time KPI analytics, streamlined multi-agent workflows using Bedrock and Athena, and introduced RAG-based anomaly detection leveraging OpenSearch. These efforts significantly reduced manual effort and improved leadership data visibility.

**Tata Consultancy Services – Analytics Engineer (2021–2023)**

I delivered analytics at scale by engineering data warehouses and OLAP marts for commodity trading. Core contributions involved optimizing ETL operations and driving real-time data warehousing solutions with Python, SQL, and Talend. My analytics pipelines powered critical executive dashboards and enabled quantitative research, boosting operational productivity across multiple business verticals.

**Northeastern University – Graduate Teaching Assistant (2024–present)**

As a GTA for courses in Data Warehousing and Analytics Engineering, I mentored graduate cohorts, supporting curriculum delivery and hands-on data modeling projects.
