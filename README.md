# Hi, I'm Sinduja Vengadesan ☁️🤖
## Who am I? 
I am currently a grad student at Northeastern University, Boston, backed by 3+ years of hands-on experience in the data engineering and analytics domain. My expertise lies around building robust and scalable DB models, architecting & building efficient data pipelines, and developing analytical frameworks bridging the gap between raw data and business insights. In my free time, you can find me solving Sudoku, playing Chess and Badminton, and reading all kinds of books on my Kindle.
